# URL Summarization Service

This Cloudflare Worker script fetches content from a provided URL, extracts the plain text using \`cheerio\`, and uses the OpenAI API to summarize the content based on user preferences such as word count and style.

## Features

- Fetches HTML content from a URL.
- Validates the URL and user preferences.
- Extracts plain text from HTML using \`cheerio\`.
- Summarizes the extracted text using the OpenAI API based on user-defined preferences like word count and style.
- Handles common errors such as invalid URLs, missing preferences, content retrieval failure, and API errors.

## Technologies Used

- OpenAI: For summarizing text using the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- Cheerio: For parsing and extracting plain text from HTML content.
- JavaScript: For building the serverless function logic.
- Cloudflare Workers: Serverless deployment (environment variable used for the OpenAI API key).

## Installation & Setup

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.
- Cloudflare Workers CLI tool [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/get-started/) installed.
- OpenAI API key to access the GPT-3.5-turbo model.


## Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GrimCLown/-Content-Summarizer-Service-Task.git
  cd project-name
```

### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Set Up Environment Variables
Create a \`.dev.vars\` and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

## Configure wrangler.toml to Enable Miniflare
In your wrangler.toml file, ensure that miniflare is enabled for local development. This allows you to use environment variables locally.

Add or update the following line in your wrangler.toml:

```bash
miniflare = true
```
Your wrangler.toml file should look something like this:

```bash
name = "your-worker-name"
type = "javascript"
account_id = "your-account-id"
workers_dev = true
miniflare = true
```
This configuration ensures that your OpenAI API key is available for local development using Miniflare, and it will be included when running the worker in your development environment.

## Running Locally

To test the function locally, use wrangler to simulate Cloudflare Workers. Wrangler automatically reads environment variables from .dev.vars.

Make sure your Wrangler CLI is installed. If not, install it by running:

npm install -g wrangler

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

## Deployment to Cloudflare Workers
After testing locally, you can deploy the function to Cloudflare Workers. Ensure you're authenticated with Cloudflare by running:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

Add the OpenAI API key as a secret:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Deploy the Worker by running:

```bash
npx wrangler publish
```

This will deploy the project to your Cloudflare account, and you'll get a unique URL for your Worker.

## Usage
This function expects a POST request with a JSON body containing the following fields:

- url (string): The URL from which to fetch and summarize content.
- preferences (object):
  - wordCount (integer): The maximum number of words for the summary.
style (string): The desired style of the summary (e.g., formal, casual, etc.).
  - Testing the URL Summarization Service with Postman
Once you have the service running locally or deployed on Cloudflare Workers, you can test the API using Postman to ensure it functions as expected.

# Testing the URL Summarization Service with Postman
Once you have the service running locally or deployed on Cloudflare Workers, you can test the API using Postman to ensure that it's functioning as expected.

## Step 1: Open Postman
Install Postman from the official website if you haven’t already. Open Postman on your system.

## Step 2: Ensure the Service is Running
Before proceeding, make sure your summarization service is either running locally or deployed on Cloudflare Workers:

If running locally with Wrangler, ensure that it’s running by using the command:

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```
If deployed, confirm that the Cloudflare Worker is live and accessible via its URL.

If it’s not yet deployed, you can deploy the Worker using the following command:
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```
This will deploy your Cloudflare Worker and provide a live URL that you can use for testing.

## Step 3: Set Up a New Request
Click New and select HTTP Request to create a new request. Select the POST method. In the Request URL field, enter the local or deployed URL for your Cloudflare Worker API. For example:

- If testing locally with Wrangler: http://localhost:8787/summarize
- If deployed on Cloudflare: https://your-worker-subdomain.workers.dev/summarize

## Step 4: Configure Request Headers
Under the Headers tab, ensure the following header is added:

```bash
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Step 5: Set Up the Request Body
Switch to the Body tab.

Choose raw and set the format to JSON.

Add the following JSON structure to send the necessary data to the API:

```bash
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "preferences": {
    "wordCount": 150,
    "style": "concise"
  }
}
```
- url: The URL of the content you want to summarize (replace with the actual URL you are testing).
- wordCount: The preferred word count for the summary.
- style: The style of the summary (e.g., concise, detailed, casual, etc.).

## Step 6: Send the Request
Once you’ve configured the headers and body, click Send to execute the request. Postman will send the data to your Cloudflare Worker, which will fetch the content from the specified URL, extract the plain text using Cheerio, and summarize it using the OpenAI API based on your preferences.

## Step 7: Review the Response
In the Response section of Postman, you should see the summarized text returned by your Cloudflare Worker. The response will look something like this:

```bash
{
  "summary": "This is a concise summary of the content from the provided URL."
}
```
If there are any issues, such as an invalid URL or API error, you will see an error message in the response:

```bash
{
  "error": "Invalid URL",
  "message": "The URL provided is either missing or not in a valid format. Please check the URL and try again."
}
```

## Step 8: Testing Error Handling
You can also test the error-handling mechanisms by providing incorrect or missing data, such as:

  - Invalid URL formats.
  - Missing preferences (e.g., wordCount or style).
  - Unreachable URLs.
The expected responses should include relevant error messages, such as:

```bash
{
  "error": "Invalid URL",
  "message": "The URL provided is either missing or not in a valid format. Please check the URL and try again."
}
```


## Conclusion
This service provides a robust and flexible solution for summarizing web content using Cheerio for text extraction and the OpenAI API for generating concise summaries. Follow the steps above to set it up, run it locally, deploy it on Cloudflare Workers, and test it using Postman.
